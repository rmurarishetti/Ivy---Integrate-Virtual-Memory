All Runs are 10 Docs
Each message has a random delay between 0 and 50 ms associated with to simulate real network delay

Benchmarking Process:
1. Each Node executes a read of document id similar to the nodes id
2. Each Node executes a write of document id similar to the nodes id
3. Each Node executes read of a document id greater by 1 than its own node id
4. Each Node executes write of a document id greater by 1 than its own node id

q4. Performance Comparison between Non Fault Tolerant Ivy and Fault Tolerant Ivy with No Faults

Non Fault Tolerant Ivy
1 Node, 10 Docs : 0.27 seconds
2 Node, 10 Docs : 0.63 seconds
3 Node, 10 Docs : 1.14 seconds
4 Node, 10 Docs : 1.27 seconds
5 Node, 10 Docs : 1.51 seconds
6 Node, 10 Docs : 1.87 seconds
7 Node, 10 Docs : 2.28 seconds
8 Node, 10 Docs : 2.82 seconds
9 Node, 10 Docs : 2.95 seconds
10 Node, 10 Docs : 3.48 seconds

Fault Tolerant Ivy
Added complexity of fault tolerance includes message passing between backup CM and primary CM. The initialisation of these instances and warm up by message exchanges adds to the time taken for the benchmarking process.
The benchmarking process is the same as the non fault tolerant Ivy. The only difference is the messages used to sync the states between the primary and backup CMs that are carried out asynchronously and periodically.

q5. Performance Comparison between Non Fault Tolerant Ivy and Fault Tolerant Ivy with 1 Fault

It will not be fair to compare the performance of non fault tolerant Ivy with fault tolerant Ivy with 1 fault.

For this comparison we will use the performance of fault tolerant Ivy with no faults as the baseline.

Fault Tolerant Ivy with 1 Fault
a. CM fails at a random time during the execution of the benchmarking process
b. CM fails at a random time during the execution of the benchmarking process and recovers after a random time
